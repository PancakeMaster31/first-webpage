    <div id="How">
      <h3>How to Play:</h3>
      It is best to play with a group of 7 people and up. There should also be one narrator, who will administer the game.
      The game will start with the night. And once the night is over the day starts.
      <h4> <strong> Night:</strong> </h4>
      During the night the mafia are the first to wake up and choose someone to kill.
      Then they fall back asleep and the detective will choose to invsetigate someone. The narrator should take
      note of who is each role, and each night let the players do their role.
      <h4> <strong> Day: </strong> </h4>
      During the day everyone disusses who they think is bad and if people want to share their role they can.
      After talking for a little everyone decides two people to put up on trial, and then the people who are
      accused must state their alibi. Once this is done, everyone votes for who they want to die, and the person
      with the most votes dies. As they leave the circle, the narrator says their role.
